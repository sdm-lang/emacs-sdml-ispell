# SDML mode spell-checking for Emacs

![SDML Logo Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdm-lang/.github/main/profile/horizontal-text.svg)

This package provides *selective* spell checking using [ispell](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Spelling.html) for SDML -
the [Simple Domain Modeling Language](https://github.com/johnstonskj/tree-sitter-sdml) buffers.

Following the behavior of `flyspell-prog-mode`, this mode only checks the nodes
corresponding to comments and strings.

## Installing

Install is easiest from MELPA, here's how with `use-package`. Note the hook clause
to ensure this minor mode is always enabled for SDML source files.

```elisp
(use-package sdml-ispell
  :after (ispell sdml-mode)
  :hook (sdml-mode . sdml-ispell-mode)
```

Or, interactively; `M-x package-install RET sdml-ispell RET`

## Bindings

- `C-c C-s s` -- spell check the item at point
- `C-c C-s C-s` -- spell check all items in the buffer

## Contributing

This package includes an [Eldev](https://github.com/emacs-eldev/eldev) file and the following MUST be run before
creating any PR.

- `eldev lint`
- `eldev doctor`
- `eldev package --load-before-compiling --stop-on-failure --warnings-as-errors`

The script [eldev-check.sh](https://gist.github.com/johnstonskj/6af5ef6866bfb1288f4962a6ba3ef418) may be useful to you if you do not have your own Eldev workflow.
